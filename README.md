# Catan-Tracker
After cloning this repository, do `npm start` in the terminal to launch the site.
The site allows you to add settlements and add what tiles your building are on. Clicking on the building icon will upgrade it into a city and clicking on the tiles will prompt what resource it is and what die number it has.
The second tab has the die frequency graph and the resource stats for the players.
There is no local or server-side saving of the game, but the site allows you to export a game file to save on your local device and you can import that file to continue where you left off.
The site will not keep track of any victory points, development cards, or stolen/blocked cards.  It also has no in-built error tracking, so you could add 8 cities for example on the site when you could not in game.

This was a small personal project for stats nerds such as myself who wanted to show my friends that my luck was simply better.
